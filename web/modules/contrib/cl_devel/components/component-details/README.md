### Where is it used?

This component is used in the detail page of a component for the component audit
pages.

### Anatomy

The component contains two sections. The upper section shows a table of some key
metadata, along with the component thumbnail. If the component has no thumbnail,
then a default one is provided.

The lower part of the component containst the HTML version of the README.md file
inside the component directory.

### Considerations

This component is very bespoke. However, there may be parts that could be used
elsewhere. In particular:

  - The metadata table.
  - The component thumbnail.
